Buffalo Zip Code Investment Analysis
In this analysis, we are examining various Buffalo zip codes to determine the best investment opportunities using clustering techniques and data-driven metrics. The steps of the analysis are:

Data Preprocessing: Clean and normalize the data.
Clustering: Apply K-means clustering to group zip codes based on key metrics like crime rates, home prices, and appreciation potential.
PCA: Use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction to help visualize the clusters and identify patterns.
Sensitivity Analysis: Evaluate how changes in the weights of various metrics (crime, appreciation, income) affect the rankings of zip codes.
Recommendations: Based on the analysis, we recommend which zip codes offer the best opportunities for different real estate investment strategies (e.g., buy-and-hold, fix-and-flip, BRRRR).
